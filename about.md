# Icon Hack Helper

A simple utility mod that helps you know which icons you actually have unlocked while using Icon Hack.
You can change if you want to have a background or change the opacity in the settings.

Huge thank-yous to [hiimjasmine00](https://github.com/hiimjasmine00) for helping out with the mod!
